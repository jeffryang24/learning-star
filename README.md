# Learning :star:

This is a monorepo for every language that I learnt before. I know some of the exercise were not done in schedule, some project are in dangling state, but I just keep learning it while I still have time to reach it.

> Too old to know `C`, while in the youth time always got A. It's not too late to learn something, cause we are learning the star above us.
